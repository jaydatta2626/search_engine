    <h3>The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy and sell crypto on its platform.



        After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October 2020, PayPal is finally allowing
        users the ability to natively transfer, send and receive digital assets between PayPal and other wallets and
        exchanges. As of Tuesday, the feature is available to select U.S. users, with the feature expanding to all
        eligible U.S. users in the coming weeks. The first batch of supported coins consists of Bitcoin
        BTC $16,704, Ether ETH $1,217, Bitcoin Cash BCH $100, and Litecoin LTC $74.58.
        In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can spend it via Checkout at millions of merchant
        terminals. The company has been granted a full Bitlicense by the New York Department of Financial Services for
        the conduct.
        Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and enter the crypto section of the application to start
        transferring coins. Users are generally required to complete a one-time ID verification before the procedure.
        Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based on their respective
        blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not incur such fees. To protect users' privacy, the firm
        generates a new recipient address for each transaction into one's PayPal account. PayPal will also not charge
        fees for incoming transfers,
        The company is also working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services, such as central bank digital
        currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also exploring the possibility of launching its own
        stablecoin, dubbed "PayPal Coin." The discovery came after a developer found evidence of such a stablecoin
        within the source code of the company's iPhone app.</h3>
